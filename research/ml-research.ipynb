    "There has been a large amount of theorizing into the context of being successful in the stock market using machine learning or algorithmic trading. This section of this repo is to conduct research and testing into whether it is possible or even viable to use machine learning to make decisions for generating a significant profit. This will be used to conduct research and be posted to the world once a conclusion of sorts has been created. \n",

    "Financial success has always been a sin that we all strive for. This can be motivated by many things: passion, curiousity, rage, or something that can only be understood by the person in question. Either way the idea of tools and software streamlining and generating wealth is more of a pipe dream to that end. This has been proven to cause issues and problems with many people with unrealistic ideas of the concept. Hence why this will dive into depth about the truth and reality of such systems by both explaining and showing you the likely results.  "
